# GastricCancer_RNASeqAnalysis
Gastric Cancer (GC) is recognized as one of the causes of cancer incidence around the globe. Moreover, it was identified as the third major cause of death by oncological disease. 

To the best of our knowledge, there are several factors associated to the formation and progression of GC, namely molecular, genetic, environmental factors, and epigenetic alterations.

As for epigenetic alterations, DNA metilations, histone modifications, nucleossome positioning and non codifying RNA. 

Following up the work of Baek and colaborators (2015), this analysis will focus in DNA metylation. This phenomenon has been reported as one of the major causes of carcinogenesis.

Taking into account the work of Baek and colaborators (2015), the main goal of present work is to analyse the RNA-seq data obtained from GC patients and healthy samples. Moreover, it aims at finding differences between proximal and distal regulatory regions of GC patient samples and healthy cases. For this, RNA-seq data of normal and tumoral tissues was analysed and characterized.
